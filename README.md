# Knowledge Graph
This is the repository where all the work towards the creation of the TheyBuyForYou knowledge graph (KG) will be done. This repository is mostly related to activities that are being done in the context of Work Packages 1 and 2. In this repository we will keep:

* Ontology model file that defines the schema for the TBFY knowledge graph  [ [.ttl file](https://github.com/TBFY/knowledge-graph/blob/master/model/tbfy-ontology.ttl) ]
* UML model with the main concepts of the ontology [ [.mdj file](https://github.com/TBFY/knowledge-graph/blob/master/model/tbfy-ontology-model.mdj) ]
* Source code for the data ingestion services that are being developed for onboarding data to the knowledge graph [ [repository folder](https://github.com/TBFY/knowledge-graph/tree/master/data-ingestion) ]
* Modules with references to related ontologies in the public procurement domain.
* Documentation of the knowledge graph schema (ontology) and related services that is being developed.

# References

* [OCDS ontology](https://github.com/TBFY/ocds-ontology) for procurement data. This ontology is being developed in the [TBFY project](http://theybuyforyou.eu) as part of the work on the main TBFY ontology.
* [euBusinessGraph ontology](https://github.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data) for company data. This ontology is being developed in the [euBusinessGraph project](http://eubusinessgraph.eu/) and used by the TBFY ontology, which in addition to representing procurement data also aims to define links between procurement data and companies.
