# Knowledge Graph
This is the repository where all the work towards the creation of the TheyBuyForYou knowledge graph will be done. This repository is mostly related to activities that are being done in the context of Work Packages 1 and 2. In this repository we will keep:

* Ontology model files in OWL format ([.owl file](https://github.com/TBFY/knowledge-graph/blob/master/model/new-ocds-ontology.owl))
* Ontology model files in TTL format ([.ttl file](https://github.com/TBFY/knowledge-graph/blob/master/model/new-ocds-ontology.ttl))
* UML model with the main concepts of the ontology ([.mdj file](https://github.com/TBFY/knowledge-graph/blob/master/model/ocds-ontology-model.mdj))
* Source code for the data ingestion module ([repository folder](https://github.com/TBFY/knowledge-graph/tree/master/data-ingestion))
